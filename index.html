    <h3>Sorry Cutie Pie Acel :<</h3>
    <p>First of all, I wanna say sorry for all those things that I did to you that makes you mad or cry because my stupid brain thinks that you will not leave no matter what I will do to you because I know that you don't have the ability to lose me in your life but I was wrong for thinking that way, maybe my brain isn't braining that's why I didn't think the possible outcomes of my actions</p>

    <p>You know first time seeing you way back when we were in junior high (grade 9), at first I'm just seeing you as my potential friend but when time passedby I realized that my feelings for you went deeper, everytime when someone is very close to you, I get jealous for no reason, I don't know whyy and that's the time when I started adoring you, I remember when you have a suitor before (grade 10 era), I was really jealous bro for real then I got a stupid idea again bro, my stupidass brain thinks that I need someone to crush on so that you will get jealous too like what you did to me hmm</p>
    
    <p>I watched you two of you together having a sweet moments before secretly like I was thinking that "that should be mee~~" yk sometimes I hate my brain, I also remember when I cried because I felt so ignored by you :<, I was having my hard time but I overcome those things when we started doing duo in mlbb hehe and I got a stupid idea again, my brain said "confess your feelings to her, grab the chance" then that's what I did, I confess my feelings to you sincerely but you'd thinking I was fooling you around like broðŸ‘º and that's how our love story began'</p>
    
    <p>
      I suddenly remembered all those things when I was thinking to end our relationship, my hardships will be throw away if I'll let my angerness it me up, that's why I ended up thinking that I need to change my toxic trait inside me, I don't let it to ruin our relationship, all my hardships and patience will be nothing if I keep doing the same thing to you, I gotta change for the better for us so that your love for me won't fade, that's my biggest fear, you know beybss I really don't want to lose in my life, I would rather die than to live without you, you're my everything po, I want to apologize sincerely and express how much I love you by doing this<, I hope this is enough po to ease my wrongdoings po, iloveyouuuu poo cutie pie koo:3</p>
